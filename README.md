# Notes app demo

Aiming to learn about Meteor, I made a Note app (based on Todo app) that let user to add notes. it shows the title, content, date of creation and the creator.

The idea is to add more functionalities like add images, code, hyperlinks and todo lists and let interact and modify notes to more than one user.
